- **Project Name** : Prediction of respiratory viral infection in virus exposed individuals
- **Description**  : Respiratory viruses are highly infectious and cause acute illness in millions of people every year. However, there is wide variation in the physiologic response to exposure at the individual level. Some people that are exposed to the virus can completely avoid infection. Others contract viruses but can fight it off without exhibiting any symptoms of illness such as coughing, sneezing, sore throat or fever. It is not well understood what characteristics may protect individuals from respiratory viral infection. -In sub challenge 1, we are interested in the prediction of individuals that become infected with a virus and contagious following nasal exposure. 
                     This is quantified by measuring the shedding of virus from nasal passages on subsequent daysâ€™ post-exposure.
    - In sub-challenges 1, we are interested in the prediction of individuals that demonstrate symptomatic response following viral exposure. 
    - In sub challenge 2, symptoms are measured as a binary outcome defined by whether an individual becomes symptomatic following exposure
