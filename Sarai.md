- **#Project**     : 1
- **Author**       : Sarai
- **Project Name** : X-Pi
- **Description**  : A group of us worked (and to an extent are still working) on deploying trained models that detect lung problems onto Raspberry Pis so that they are portable to be able to aid in diagnosing problems in rural/remote areas.  The dataset used is CheXpert (the link to the dataset is in the README).
